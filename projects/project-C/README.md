# Welcome to the Lantern World
![Animated Cover](projectC.gif)
In this project, I created a night space where everyone is represented as a lantern. The user will appear on the page when he/she clicks on the "create lantern" button.

## Description

After the you created your own lantern on the page, you can click on it to make it get brighter and brighter. After certain clicks, your lantern's brightness will come down to zero again. It works just like your lamp but in a virtual space. Meanwhile, you can see other joined users' lanterns and how they change the brightness.

## Quick Start

You can join this lantern world by clicking [here](https://deep-typhoon-monday.glitch.me/)
