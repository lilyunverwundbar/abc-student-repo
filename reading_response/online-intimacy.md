As McHugh points out in his article, online relationship has become more and more popular and convenient even for the nerds. He points out the communication between screens is no longer awkward thanks to the "internet-specific ways to flirt and show affection so that people can now have natural interactions without being in the same room" (McHugh). Indeed, I know a lot of people who are very timid in real life can be so active and even aggressive in the virtual world, bearing the desire to express themselves otherwise won't be shown in the physical world.<br>

The developers of digital applications and websites are also constantly trying to improve the experience of interaction online. During the pandemic, for example, Zoom has been extremely pervasive for classes and meetings. A lot of academic institutions like Carnegie Mellon University is trying to embed VR into online communication to make people feel more like in the same space as others. <br>

Online fandom is also a very interesting community where the participants need to know about related jargon. Fans can happily communicate only if they all understand the "secret words" that is only recognized among those who are zealous about the same idol.
