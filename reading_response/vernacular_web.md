It's interesting to retrospect the old web designs when the internet just emerged. The author mentioned several characteristics of early web appearance: starry wallpapers, background picture that repeats itself horizontally and vertically, and glitter. These were the trends in the 1990s. Even when I was young, about 2010, I remembered we had personal avatars on QQ(a chatting media) and kids were so obsessed with decorating the avatar with fancy, shiny outfits. And less frequently I would see some websites with old-fashioned fonts, with clear serration which I believe is what most webpages are filled with in the old times. Now if I see a website like this with glittering stickers, I would think the aesthetic is too outdated. From my experience, apart from the distinction between the appearance of the early and current web, the use of web among young people has changed a lot. When I was in primary school, my peers and I loved to play web games, like cooking, planting and stealing others' fruit, racing... And the kids nowadays like to play games on cellphones which is more portable. And now my peers like to post vlogs on video channels and plogs. The aesthetics of websites also switched more to minimalism and a little interaction with the users. I prefer the looks of the web now, but it's definitely fun to look at some vintage designs if they can convey certain vibes in the 90s.
